# FLUID-SIMULATION-SAGA-again-
Did even more this time, it can handle much, much more particles! And also integrated engine physics very poorly, so not really sure if I should be sharing it right now... I may have coded the optimizations poorly. But here is what I made right now. A simple fluid simulation! (with the help of Sebastian Lague of course!)
